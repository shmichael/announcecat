    <p>Move mixer allows you to practice jazz steps so that you can memorize them,
    and transition freely between different steps.
    <h2>Recommended usage instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li> Input a set of jazz moves you want to practice. One per line.
      <li> Click one of the buttons to generate a sequence of random moves. Your options are to generate a completely random set, a random set with structure (AAAB or ABAB), or to use the moves you provided in the order you provided them.
      <li> Select a song that you like and input its bpm (or use the built-in generated cymbals).
      <li> Hit "play" in the <b><i>middle</i></b> of a phrase in your song.
      <li> The app will read out a move. Perform it <b><i>on the next phrase</i></b>. That means wait for the current phrase to end, then transition to the new step. During every phrase you'll be performing a step, and the app will give you a step for the next one. (Similar to callouts at the end of the Shim Sham).
